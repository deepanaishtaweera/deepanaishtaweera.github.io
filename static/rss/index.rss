&lt;img src="http://localhost:2369/content/images/2019/12/Toastmasters.JPG" alt="Every day is a chance to learn something new 🤩"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is based on an article that I wrote to Moratuwa Toastmasters annual newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to introduce myself as a person seeking to learn new things every day. I remember how I would go online to search about new tech stuff and gadgets in my childhood. Let me explain a bit about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a very studios kid back in my school life where I wanted to do something to make my school and parents proud. I didn't have much choices. Therefore, I chose to study hard to get good grades for A/Ls. As a result, I was able to be among the &lt;strong&gt;top 5 students&lt;/strong&gt; from the country in Physical science stream for GCE A/L exams back in 2016. This achievement changed my life and proved that I'm cable of doing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting selected to Department of Electronic &amp;amp; Telecommunication engineering in the University of Moratuwa I wanted to try myself to see whether I can excel in other areas too hoping to prove the odds wrong who believe in &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;studios kids are only good at one thing&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. I joined AIESEC in 2018 (world's largest youth organization) where I was appointed as the team leader for an energy conservation project named &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Switch Off 7.0&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; where we enlightened 4 houses in a rural village providing them electricity through solar panels. Next, I started doing badminton as a sport; humbly saying that I had to learn starting from holding the &amp;quot;racquet&amp;quot; properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You're never too old to start learning, and you're never too young to aim high and achieve great things.&lt;/strong&gt; - Asa Hutchinson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't miss mentioning about my passion for robotics which I accidently figured out with 2 of my friends after competing in a robotic competition. I have participated in more 8 local robotics competitions in undergraduate level now. My small team has now grown up to a startup named &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;CircuitBreakers&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. While trying all these new things, public speaking was one of things I had last in my mind. But, I felt that the effective use of communication skills is the key to share my experience with people. That's the very reason I joined this amazing Moratuwa Toastmasters family where our fear becomes our passion. So far, it has been a great journey with this amazing family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I always believe there's nothing far from our reach. If we put our heart and soul to it, we can definitely achieve our dreams. See every moment as an opportunity to learn something new. At the end you will have so many stories to share with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

It supports almost all the languages. This is my experiment in replacing jupyter with score.</description><link>http://localhost:2369/vscode-vs-jupyter-for-opencv/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e049a88d7b20c10ec89b9f5</guid><category>Tech</category><dc:creator>Deepana Ishtaweera</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 11:34:04 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2369/content/images/2019/12/vscode-vs-jupyter-2.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src="http://localhost:2369/content/images/2019/12/vscode-vs-jupyter-2.png" alt="vscode vs jupyter for OpenCV 🚀"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to find effienct and easy tools when I need to do something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently installed anaconda package for python to learn image processing and machine learning. Most of the people are using jupyter notebook and jupyter lab to open ipython notebooks. ipython notebooks provides the feature to test the code in cell format which helps to easily visualize and debug lengthy code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my favourite code editor is &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;vscode&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, and I use this amazing editor for every coding instance I do right now starting from programming arduinos, STM boards, competitive programming and etc. Therefore, I wanted use vscode for openCV projects too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolah! ipython notebooks are working in vscode....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, I have only tested this feature in vscode for &lt;strong&gt;macOS&lt;/strong&gt; and it might contain some bugs and few errors. But, it's working fine so far. The best features I have experienced contrasting to jupyter tools are that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;access file menu side by side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use vscode shortcuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose python environment from vscode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for version control tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vscode extension support and easy searching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a animated gif of using vscode to work with ipython notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

After searching so much finally found this amazing backpack.</description><link>http://localhost:2369/finding-the-perfect-smart-backpack/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e048aeed7b20c10ec89b9dd</guid><category>Lifestyle</category><dc:creator>Deepana Ishtaweera</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 10:32:02 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2369/content/images/2019/12/compacto-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src="http://localhost:2369/content/images/2019/12/compacto-1.jpg" alt="Finding the perfect backpack for university 🎒"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelling with a backpack that I don't like is a nightmare to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to find the perfect backpack for my univeristy work, but frustrated of all the options that I could find. Even though the high pricy Swift Gear, Nike, Diesel and ect didn't quite had all the features I have been looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price is not my concern as even the higher price ones didn't have all the features I'm looking for. I wanted a backpack with many features and custom designed pockets for my favourite items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="herearesomeofthethingsthatihavelookedfor"&gt;Here are some of the things that I have looked for,&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build quility is surely one of the things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ability to safely store my 13 inch macbook pro, my ipad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ability to quickly access my power bank and earphones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;store my water bottle in a sealed quickly accessible place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;store my calculator, keys, pens in a separete pockets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carry clothes or shoes in a separate container where it acts like a luggage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;water and dust proof design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of bags were not able to fulfill my expectations and I finally came across this brand called &amp;quot;Mark Ryden&amp;quot; which I wasn't heard before. They have different backpack lineups and type &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;compacto&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; got my attention. It had almost all the features that I have been looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2369/content/images/2019/12/backpack.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Finding the perfect backpack for university 🎒"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;photos taken after receiving the backpack&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;After using the backpack for &lt;strong&gt;more than 8 months&lt;/strong&gt; now, I still enjoying carrying this with me. For all the smart backpack enthusiasts out there I will hope this will help in choosing the perfect backpack for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This backpack costs about 50 usd on aliexpress and the link to product description is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following image shows some of the items that this backpack can hold. There are both 15 inch and 17 inch models available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For lighter users, there's another backpack titled as &amp;quot;compacto pro&amp;quot; which is lighter and thinner than &amp;quot;compacto&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://localhost:2369/content/images/2019/12/breadbord_testing.JPG" alt="Why breadboard testing is essential in robot design? 🔧"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article might seem strange, but knowing these little things can make your robotics project easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;As making robots have become a part of my university life, I love to design different kinds of robots for local robotics competitions in undergraduate level. Designing a robot can be narrowed down to several steps as follows from my experience,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware design stage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breadboard testing stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PCB designing stage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assembly stage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming stage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stages will mostly overlap between each other and needs to be done parellel in order to succefully finish the project. Most of the people miss the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Breadboard testing stage&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and directly make the PCB which creates lots of problems like asigning sesors to incompatable pins, wiring issues, wrong selection of components and ect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is about my experience of making a micromouse robot using STMF103C6 &amp;quot;bluepill&amp;quot; board and how properly testing before the final designed helped to build the robot without errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second time I'm making a micrmouse and first time I used an Arduino Nano board to make the robot. The speed of the arduino boards are slow to quickly react to gyro values to accurately navigate and turn in the maze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h4 id="newtostm"&gt;New to STM?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was new to STM boards I didn't know the correct pins to connect the sensors and to programme it. Therfore before designing a pcb I thought to test everything out using a breadboard.&lt;br&gt;
Following video contains some footage of the breadboard testing stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--kg-card-end: markdown--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkV5wnVwkrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Breadnoard testing for making micromouse robot&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: markdown--&gt;&lt;h4 id="whyshouldyoudoit"&gt;Why should you do it? 💁🏻‍♂️&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have come across situations where that I search through the internet and route the PCB, after testing I findout the pins were assigned wrong. In these situations I have to go through imense work to rewire the pcb externaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By testing everything in a breadboard helped me to overcome this problem to find out the necessary pins to connect my sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
