This is\nwhere you can add tags and authors, feature a post, or turn a post into a page. \n\n> Access the post settings menu in the top right hand corner of the editor. \nPost feature image\nInsert your post feature image from the very top of the post settings menu.\nConsider resizing or optimising your image first to ensure it's an appropriate\nsize.\n\nStructured data & SEO\nCustomise your social media sharing cards for Facebook and Twitter, enabling you\nto add custom images, titles and descriptions for social media.\n\nThere’s no need to hard code your meta data. You can set your meta title and\ndescription using the post settings tool, which has a handy character guide and\nSERP preview. \n\nGhost will automatically implement structured data for your publication using\nJSON-LD to further optimise your content.\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"Article\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Publishing options\",\n        \"logo\": \"https://static.ghost.org/ghost-logo.svg\"\n    },\n    \"author\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"name\": \"Ghost\",\n        \"url\": \"http://demo.ghost.io/author/ghost/\",\n        \"sameAs\": []\n    },\n    \"headline\": \"Publishing options\",\n    \"url\": \"http://demo.ghost.io/publishing-options\",\n    \"datePublished\": \"2018-08-08T11:44:00.000Z\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2018-08-09T12:06:21.000Z\",\n    \"keywords\": \"Getting Started\",\n    \"description\": \"The Ghost editor has everything you need to fully optimise your content. This is where you can add tags and authors, feature a post, or turn a post into a page.\",\n    }\n}\n    \n\nYou can test that the structured data schema [https://schema.org/] on your site\nis working as it should using Google’s structured data tool\n[https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool]. \n\nCode Injection\nThis tool allows you to inject code on a per post or page basis, or across your\nentire site. This means you can modify CSS, add unique tracking codes, or add\nother scripts to the head or foot of your publication without making edits to\nyour theme files. \n\nTo add code site-wide, use the code injection tool in the main admin menu\n[/ghost/settings/code-injection/]. This is useful for adding a Facebook Pixel, a\nGoogle Analytics tracking code, or to start tracking with any other analytics\ntool.\n\nTo add code to a post or page, use the code injection tool within the post\nsettings menu. This is useful if you want to add art direction, scripts or\nstyles that are only applicable to one post or page. \n\nFrom here, you might be interested in managing some more specific admin settings\n[/admin-settings/]!","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/publishing-options.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2019-08-03 16:22:26","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-08-03 16:22:26","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2019-08-03 16:22:30","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"The Ghost editor has everything you need to fully optimise your content.
